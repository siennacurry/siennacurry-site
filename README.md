A personal portfolio website with a retro Y2K/Windows XP-inspired aesthetic. Designed in Figma and built from scratch using React and Next.js, featuring custom CSS styling to recreate the nostalgic look of early 2000s social media profiles. The site showcases my projects, skills, and contact information with a responsive two-column layout. Deployed on Vercel with a custom domain.
